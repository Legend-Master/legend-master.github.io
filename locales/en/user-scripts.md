## [YouTube Control Fix](https://github.com/Legend-Master/YouTube-Control-Fix)

Make youtube shortcut behavior more consistent

It stops

- Audio from changing when using the left and right arrow keys when focusing volume panel
- Video from skipping when pressing the up and down arrow keys when focusing progress bar

And make space bar play/pause more consistent

## [YouTube Subtitle Auto Switcher](https://github.com/Legend-Master/YouTube-Subtitle-Auto-Switcher)

Switching YouTube subtitle to Chinese automatically with selection priority

The reason why I made this is because there's a lot of Chinese language codes for YouTube subtitles and YouTube can only remember one of them as user selection

- It will try to switch to Chinese subtitle when you click the caption button (short cut `C` not included) and when the video first loaded
- Shift + click the caption button will enable auto translate
