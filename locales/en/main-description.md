I started up programming a lot by making mods for a game called Don't Starve Together at first and later on shared some of them on GitHub as open source projects

And then I leaned more about software related things though Harvard CS50 and other online resources along with reading and even started writing code for some bigger open source softwares as well as some personal projects

In the process, I tried to code/fix website, IDE plugin, VPN, browser, and a lot of hacking with browser extension/user scripts and game mods

For programming languages, I'm pretty fluent in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Lua, experienced in Java, C#, C, C++, somewhat knowledged in Kotlin, Rust, Go and can pick up new ones within days (modern languages are pretty similar)
