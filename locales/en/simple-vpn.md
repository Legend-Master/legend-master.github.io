A simple peer to peer VPN for gaming and speeding up WebRTC like applications by using VPN tunnel as relay instead of their server (only works for some)

- Broadcast support, it can be used to play some old games in LAN mode multiplayer
- No encryption, it doesn't provide a secure tunnel like other VPNs
- Support x86_64 Windows and Linux
